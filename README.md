[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A simple web application built with Next.js to summarize lengthy text content using AI, providing concise insights quickly.

## ‚ú® Features

* **AI-Powered Summarization**: Utilizes an AI model via an external API to generate accurate and relevant summaries.
* **Time Saving**: Quickly transforms long articles, documents, or any text (between 250-300 words for optimal results based on current setup) into key points.
* **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-use interface with clear input and output sections.
* **Word Count**: Real-time word count feedback for the input text.
* **Dark Mode**: Supports light and dark themes for user preference.
* **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a seamless experience on different devices.

## ü§î How It Works

Getting your summary is straightforward:

1.  **Paste Your Text**: Copy and paste the text you want to summarize into the input text area (Minimum 250 words, ideally not exceeding 300 based on current validation).
2.  **Click Summarize**: Hit the "Mulai Ringkas" button.
3.  **Get Your Summary**: The AI processes the content, and the concise summary appears below instantly.

The application sends the text to a Next.js API route (`/api/summarize`) which then forwards the request to the backend summarization service hosted separately.
